    <h1>The Luhya Nation</h1>
    <p>The Luhya people are one of Kenyaâ€™s largest ethnic groups, mainly found in the western region across Kakamega, Bungoma, Vihiga, Busia, and parts of Trans Nzoia. They consist of about 18 sub-tribes, including the Bukusu, Maragoli, Wanga, and Isukha, who share similar language roots and cultural practices. Traditionally, the Luhya are Bantu-speaking people believed to have migrated from Central Africa, and they value unity, community life, and respect for elders.</p>
    <p>Family is central to Luhya culture, with strong extended family ties and great respect for parents and elders. Marriage customs often involve the payment of a dowry in livestock and are celebrated with songs, dances, and feasting. The Luhya are predominantly farmers, growing crops like maize and sugarcane, while also engaging in trade and modern professions. Christianity is widely practiced today, though traditional beliefs in ancestral spirits and rituals still hold cultural importance.</p>
    <p>Music and dance play a major role in Luhya traditions, with the Isukuti dance standing out as a lively symbol of their heritage. Important rites such as circumcision among the Bukusu mark the transition from boyhood to manhood, celebrated through community gatherings. Despite modernization and urban influence, the Luhya people maintain a strong sense of identity, pride, and cultural continuity.</p>
